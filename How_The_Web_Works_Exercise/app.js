// Part One: Solidify Terminology

// What is a HTTP?
// HTTP is how web browsers and Servers communicate.

// What is a URL?
// A URL is a unique address of a resource or page on the Web.

// What is DNS?
// DNS stands for Domain Name System. It will take a url and "translate" into the 
// corresponding ip address.

// What is a query string?
// It is part of the URL that has keys and value pairs. They are added to a url
// to give more information to the website server when you enter a url.

// What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
// The most common verbs are GET and POST. A GET request will request information 
// from some server on the internet. A POST request will request that some
// information on the server to be changed or added.

// What is an HTTP request?
// Information that is sent to a server from your web browser. 

// What is an HTTP response?
// Information that is sent to your web browser from a server. Usually after a HTTP request.

// What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
// A header is line of code that details information when your browser is making a request.
// It can set the language of the page and give other information like status code, request method, and dates.

// What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
// Your browser will try to obtain the IP address for that URL and make a http request to the server at that
// address for the information you requested based on your url and other predefined variables. Your browser
// might have the IP address, if not then it will check your router, then your ISP and lastly it will contact a DNS
// server if needed. After the address is found your browser will make a http request to the server of that
// address and the server will collect and organize all the data you asked for and send it to your browser.
// Your browser will then display that information to you.
